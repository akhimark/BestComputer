## The Beginning

I started learning JavaScript a year ago. It was a challenging but rewarding experience.

### Why JavaScript?

- It's versatile and can be used both on the front-end and back-end.
- The community is massive and provides plenty of resources.
- The ecosystem is rich with frameworks and libraries.

### Key Concepts I Learned

1. **Variables**: How to declare variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.
2. **Functions**: Writing both regular and arrow functions.
3. **Asynchronous Programming**: Understanding `Promises`, `async/await`, and `callbacks`.

### Favorite Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for in-depth JavaScript documentation.
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) for a beginner-friendly introduction to JavaScript.

### Sample Code

Here's a simple function that greets the user:

```javascript
function greetUser(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greetUser("Jane")); // Output: Hello, Jane!
```

```

```
