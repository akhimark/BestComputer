## Introduction to Components

React components are the building blocks of any React application. They are reusable and encapsulate their own structure, behavior, and state.

### Types of Components

1. **Functional Components**: Simple functions that return JSX.
2. **Class Components**: Components defined using ES6 classes.

### Example of a Functional Component

```javascript
import React from "react";

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

```

```
